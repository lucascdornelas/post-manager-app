# Post Manager

This project was developed as part of a technical challenge to evaluate frontend development skills. The goal is to create a functional and responsive web application using modern tools and best practices.

The application is a post management system that allows users to list, create, edit, and delete posts. For this purpose, the public JSONPlaceholder API was used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: For building dynamic and interactive interfaces
- **React Query**: Efficient request and cache management
- **TypeScript**: For business logic and data manipulation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive and consistent styling
- **Vite**: Build tool for faster development
- **Jest and React Testing Library**: Unit testing

## ✅ Implemented Features

- 📝 **Full CRUD**: List, create, edit, and delete posts
- 🔍 **Form validation**: Required fields and error messages
- ⚙️ **Visual feedback**: Loading indicators and success/error messages
